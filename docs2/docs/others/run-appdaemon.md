AppDaemon let's you run Home Assistant automation with Python code, instead of yaml configuration.
When it comes simple automations, yaml or the Automation editor are great, but if the automation gets more complicated, then it gets more difficult to control through yaml, this is where AppDaemon comes into place.

This is the reason this project is built on top of AppDaemon. Now you might be convinced, but you have no idea of how to install it and set it up. If you are using Home Assistant with the Supervisor, you can install the addon called `AppDaemon 4` from the addon store. You can follow the addon instructions and once is up and running, you can check the [installation](../start/installation) page.
